<title>Yeah, well, hold THIS, buddy.</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crossword Tommy&quot; Coburn, scourge of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eschatonblog.com/2004/10/rampant-lesbianism.html&quot;&gt;bathroom lesbians&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, is notorious among his colleagues for being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/02/AR2007100202171.html&quot;&gt;serial abuser of the Senatorial &quot;hold,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; used to block legislation from coming to the floor for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lots of people have wondered how it is that Coburn is able to hold up so many bills, many of them extremely popular on both sides of the aisle. Well, the truth is that a hold by itself doesn&#39;t actually stop legislation. A lot of other factors have to come together to make it work, but that&#39;s a subject for another day.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, let&#39;s just enjoy the anticipation of seeing what happens when those other factors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0608/Coburn_Omnibus_planned_for_July.html&quot;&gt;begin to unravel:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is planning a &quot;Coburn Omnibus&quot; for July that would wrap most if not all of the bills held by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) into one large measure to be voted on by the Senate, according to a Coburn aide and two Democratic leadership staffers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Coburn is blocking roughly a hundred bills that are generally non-controversial or have broad support. By placing a hold, Coburn prevents the bills from passing quickly through the Senate under a unanimous consent request. With floor time at such a premium, Reid would have trouble bringing up each bill for an individual debate and vote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in a stroke of legislative creativity that may have no precedent, Reid could lump all of the bills into one package and bring up the Coburn Omnibus for a single vote. Coburn can still object, but the broad popularity of the bills means that there would likely be more than enough support for veto-proof passage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ha-ha!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This would really be a terrific play by Reid. Individually, these bills -- though they enjoy popular, bipartisan support -- aren&#39;t by themselves a high enough priority for the use of Senate floor time to justify jumping through the hoops of Coburn&#39;s objections, motions to proceed, cloture votes, etc. But lumped together, they can all be moved at once, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;lean on one another for the support of a large majority of Senators, many of whom have had e-friggin&#39;-nuff of Coburn&#39;s shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kudos to Reid for the idea, and a backhanded thanks to Crossword Tommy for illustrating for us why, once upon a time at least, Senators didn&#39;t just put holds on everything under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>Obama&#39;s goals</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/141649/021</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rolling Stone gets Obama to give the most succinct explanation of his goals as president:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;WENNER: &quot;Is there a marker you would lay down at the end of your first term where you say, &amp;lsquo;If this has happened or not happened, I would consider it a negative mark on my governance&amp;rsquo;?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OBAMA: &quot;If I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten combat troops out of Iraq, passed universal health care and created a new energy policy that speaks to our dependence on foreign oil and deals seriously with global warming, then we&amp;rsquo;ve missed the boat. Those are three big jobs, so it&amp;rsquo;s going to require a lot of attention and imagination, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to require the American people feeling inspired enough that they&amp;rsquo;re prepared to take on these big challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rolling Stone has a truncated version of that article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/21472234&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though the quote above is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/playbook/0608/playbook349.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And check it out -- our guy knows how to use a computer:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;324&quot; src=&quot;http://images.dailykos.com/images/user/3/Obama_computer.jpg&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>FISA Delayed until July 8</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/193828/906</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a temporary reprieve, not a victory, but Senators Dodd and Feingold have worked with Durbin and Reid to delay the FISA vote until July 8.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Feingold&#39;s statement (via e-mail):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;m pleased we were able to delay a vote on FISA until after the July 4th holiday instead of having it jammed through. I hope that over the July 4th holiday, Senators will take a closer look at this deeply flawed legislation and understand how it threatens the civil liberties of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is possible to defend this country from terrorists while also protecting the rights and freedoms that define our nation.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dodd&#39;s statement (via e-mail:)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I&amp;rsquo;m pleased that consideration of the FISA Amendments Act has been delayed until after the 4th of July recess. I urge my colleagues to take this time to listen to their constituents and consider the dangerous precedent that would be set by granting retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that may have engaged in President Bush&amp;rsquo;s illegal wiretapping program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When and if FISA does come back to the Senate floor, I will offer my amendment to strip the retroactive immunity provision out of the bill. I implore my colleagues to support the rule of law and join me in voting against retroactive immunity.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Feingold/Dodd amendment to strip immunity from the bill will be voted on, as will a couple of other amendments. As of now, I don&#39;t have complete information on them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s a fantastic opportunity to talk to your Senators, when they&#39;re home for the most patriotic of all holidays, about what this bill means to you as a constitutent. If they&#39;re having town meetings, please attend and bring up the bill, or try to schedule individual meetings with them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, if you have the time and the ink and the paper available, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/56332p&quot;&gt;print a copy of the bill&lt;/a&gt; (114 pages, pdf), highlight the salient parts (like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/135827/968/681/542407&quot;&gt;WMD section&lt;/a&gt;) and ask them to &lt;strong&gt;please read the bill&lt;/strong&gt;, and then decide if it&#39;s really something they want to have on their permanent record as having supported.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a longshot, but it&#39;s the only one we&#39;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>Scalia or wingnut blogger?</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/13425/6688</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Really, there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/06/returned-to-the.html&quot;&gt;no difference anymore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his dissent in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/06-1195.pdf&quot;&gt;Boumedienne&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), Justice Scalia wrote:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield.&quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I read this, I wondered about the word &#39;returned&#39;, since it seems to assume that these detainees were enemy combatants when they were captured. But I didn&#39;t wonder whether 30 prisoners had, in fact, taken up arms against the US since their release. I don&#39;t keep track of these things, and the idea that people whom we had locked up for years, without justification, might take up arms against us didn&#39;t seem all that farfetched. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Seton Hall decided to examine this claim, originally made by the Pentagon:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#2;we&#2; are &#2;aware &#2;of&#2; dozens&#2; of &#2;cases &#2;where &#2;they &#2;have &#2;returned&#2; to&#2; militant &#2;activities,&#2; participated &#2;in&#2; anti&#3; US &#2;propaganda&#2; or &#2;other&#2; activities &#2;through &#2;intelligence &#2;gathering&#2; and &#2;media&#2; reports. &#2;(Examples: &#2;Mehsud suicide&#2; bombing &#2;in&#2; Pakistan;&#2; Tipton&#2; Three &#2;and &#2;the Road&#2; to&#2; Guantanamo; &#2;Uighurs &#2;in&#2; Albania)&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did the Tipton Three do?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=accidental_tourists&quot;&gt;Tipton Three&lt;/a&gt; were three British citizens who were captured in Afghanistan, and suspected of being members of al Qaeda, in part because they were thought, wrongly, to be in a videotape of a rally featuring bin Laden. After British intelligence cleared them of that charge (one of the three had in fact been working at a Curry&#39;s electronics store in Birmingham when the rally was taking place in Afghanistan), they were released. And after that, they participated in the movie The Road To Guantanamo. Apparently, this counts as &quot;returning to the battlefield&quot;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were interviewed for a movie about Guantanamo. &lt;em&gt;That&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; what the Pentagon (and now Alito) considers &quot;returning to the battlefield&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/06/23/doing_battle_with_due_process&quot;&gt;What about the Uighurs in Albania&lt;/a&gt;? One penned a New York Times op-ed, the other gave an interview to a reporter of the same newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;It turns out that clients of our firm, who were sent to Albania in 2006, were two of the 30. What fight had they returned to? Abu Bakker Qassim had published an op-ed in The New York Times. Adel Abdul Hakim had given an interview. These press statements were deemed hostile by the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Surely the Pentagon was joking? They weren&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I can&#39;t speak for the other 28, if indeed there are another 28, but for the two men I do know about, giving hostile interviews constituted &quot;returning to the fight.&quot;&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what did the Setan Hall researchers conclude?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Extending to the Government the benefit of the doubt as to ambiguous cases, the list of possible Guant&amp;#225;namo recidivists who could have been captured or killed on the battlefield consists of two individuals: Mohammed Ismail and Mullah Shazada. If an apartment complex in Russia falls within the definition of &quot;battlefield,&quot; then as of June 2007&amp;mdash;after the Department of Defense had already cited thirty (30) as the total number of recidivists&amp;mdash;an additional individual, Ruslan Odizhev, can be added to the list. Thus, at most&amp;mdash;of the approximately 445 detainees who have been released from Guant&amp;#225;namo&amp;mdash;three (3) detainees, or less than one percent (1%), have subsequently returned to the battlefield to be captured or killed. Two (2) other detainees (Abdul Rahman Noor and Mohammed Nayim Farouq), while not re-captured or killed, are claimed to be engaged in military activities, although the information provided by the Government in this regard cannot be cross-checked.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DoD has updated their list of former detainees who have &quot;returned to militant activities&quot;, from 30 to 12, with six of the names new to the list.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this is public information, yet a &lt;em&gt;Supreme Court Justice&lt;/em&gt; is using admittedly discredited government propaganda for his written opinions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bravo, Scalia, you are a perfect representative of your side of the ideological divide, trading in wingnut paranoia and unsubstantiated propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSISSIPPI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/markos-moulitsas/magnolia-growing-blue-2008-06-24.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote in the Hill:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a year promising one electoral surprise after another, Mississippi may be poised to offer the biggest shocker of them all &amp;mdash; Democrats may walk away on Election Day with one of the state&amp;rsquo;s Senate seats and maybe even its six electoral votes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/mississippi/election_2008_mississippi_presidential_election&quot;&gt;Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt;. 6/24. Likely voters. MoE 4% (5/27 results)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCain&lt;/strong&gt; (R) 50 (50) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama&lt;/strong&gt; (D) 44 (44)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve emailed Rasmussen asking if they have racial breakdowns. Those will be particularly important in gauging our chances in this state.

While earlier this week McCain held a narrow lead in Michigan, this week&#39;s two polls have changed the Pollster.com composite for Colorado to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pollster.com/08-MI-Pres-GE-MvO.php&quot;&gt;Obama 47.4, McCain 40.9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MINNESOTA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1284.xml?ReleaseID=1188&amp;amp;What=&amp;amp;strArea=;&amp;amp;strTime=0&quot;&gt;Quinnipiac&lt;/a&gt;. 6/17-24. Likely voters. MoE 2.5% (No trendlines)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCain&lt;/strong&gt; (R) 37 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama&lt;/strong&gt; (D) 54&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A SUSA poll a couple of days ago claimed it was a 47-46 Obama lead, but that appears to be an outlier at this time. Every other poll shows numbers along these lines, and the Pollster.com composite is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pollster.com/08-MN-Pres-GE-MvO.php&quot;&gt;Obama 51.6, McCain 38.5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WISCONSIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1284.xml?ReleaseID=1188&amp;amp;What=&amp;amp;strArea=;&amp;amp;strTime=0&quot;&gt;Quinnipiac&lt;/a&gt;. 6/17-24. Likely voters. MoE 2.5% (No trendlines)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCain&lt;/strong&gt; (R) 39 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama&lt;/strong&gt; (D) 52&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With this poll, the Wisconsin composite is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pollster.com/08-WI-Pres-GE-MvO.php&quot;&gt;Obama 50.6, McCain 40.4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that McCain is currently running ads in Minnesota in the hope that he can soften it up for contention (especially if plans on adding MN Gov. Pawlenty to his ticket). The belief is apparently that Pawlenty &lt;br /&gt;would also put Wisconsin in contention. These poll composites suggests that with the double-digit Obama leads, McCain might need to look elsewhere for fertile territory.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>The Karl Rove narrative</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/14539/5258</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Republicans have been test-driving various narratives, trying to see which one works best against Obama.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s the &quot;he&#39;s a secret Muslim Manchurian candidate&quot;, which boils down to &quot;&lt;strong&gt;he&#39;s not American&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. That narrative has been reinforced by the flag lapel pin nonsense, the &quot;he didn&#39;t put his hand over his heart during the American Anthem&quot; nonsense, the Jeremia Wright nonsense, the &quot;he wasn&#39;t born in Hawaii and he faked his birth certificate&quot; nonsense, and the &quot;his wife doesn&#39;t respect America&quot; nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;young and inexperienced&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; narrative which failed for Hillary Clinton, but hasn&#39;t stopped Republicans from giving it a shot as well. It&#39;s a change election, and few want more of the same crowd who created our current problems, but Republicans still hope to gain some traction with the charges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;country club elitist&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; narrative, which is reinforced with his arugula story, the &quot;bitter&quot; comments, and by Karl Rove senselessly repeating the mantra over and over again. Is this narrative even consistent with the &quot;America hatin&#39;&quot; one? Irrelevant. He&#39;s an elitist America hater! Or something...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, Karl Rove has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/playbook/0608/playbook349.html&quot;&gt;rolled out a new one&lt;/a&gt;, and the McCain campaign is eagerly joining the test run:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;KARL ROVE, previewing a GOP theme that will be pushed hard with reporters in the days ahead, writes in &amp;#8220;It&#39;s All About Obama&amp;#8221;: &amp;#8220;Many candidates have measured the Oval Office drapes prematurely. But Barack Obama is the first to redesign the presidential seal before the election. ... Such arrogance &amp;#8211; even self-centeredness &amp;#8211; have featured often in the Obama campaign. ... Mr. McCain will be helped if he uses Mr. Obama&#39;s actions to paint his opponent as someone driven by an all-powerful instinct to look out only for himself. In a contest over who is willing to put principle above personal ambition and self-interest,&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;McCAIN CAMPAIGN MEMO OUT THIS MORNING -- Steve Schmidt, McCain 2008 Senior Advisor, writes on &amp;#8220;Country First Vs. Self-Serving Partisanship&amp;#8221;: &amp;#8220;There has never been a time when Barack Obama has bucked the party line to lead on an issue of national importance. ... We don&#39;t need to trade Republican partisanship for Democratic partisanship. &amp;nbsp;We need to put our country first and put our politics second. That is what John McCain has done his whole life, and that is what he will do as President.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now he&#39;s a selfish, power-hungry, inexperienced American-hating country club elitist. And they&#39;ll keep throwing this mud against the wall hoping desperately that something sticks.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>The Big Tent</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/163645/833</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We finally get to announce the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigtentdenver.org/index.cfm&quot;&gt;Big Tent&lt;/a&gt;. From the press release:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When bloggers arrive to cover the Democratic National Convention this August 25-28 in Denver, they will have, for the first time, a central location to capture the nonstop action: The Big Tent, a new media center created by local organizations, national blogs, Digg, Google and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#39;re creating a central place for bloggers, new media journalists, and nonprofit leaders to have the resources they need to cover an important national event, as well as the opportunity to share ideas and talk about the critical issues facing our country,&quot; said Bobby Clark, Deputy Director of ProgressNow, a Denver-based organization that will co-host The Big Tent along with Daily Kos, The Alliance for Sustainable Colorado, and its sponsors, Digg, Google, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Big Tent will be a 9,000-square foot, two-story structure that will house work space for bloggers and new media journalists as well as a the Digg Stage with events for the public [...]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The democratization of media will contribute to the largest forum for public discourse in Presidential election history,&quot; said Beth Murphy, Senior Director of Marketing with the popular social news website, Digg. &amp;nbsp;&quot;Bloggers and citizen journalists will be critical contributors during this historic process. The Big Tent is a step toward leveling the playing field for these new media journalists who have not traditionally had the same access or resources. It also supports Digg&#39;s broader initiative to help people discover new voices and share ideas during this important election season.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ordinary citizens across the nation have used new technologies to bypass traditional gatekeepers in both the media and political worlds and single-handedly transformed the face of modern politics,&quot; said Markos Moulitsas, founder of Daily Kos. &quot;The Big Tent will allow those citizen journalists and activists, in politics and even outside of it, unparalleled access to the year&#39;s premier political event.&quot; [...]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Located at The Alliance Center at 15th &amp;amp; Wynkoop Streets, just steps away from the Pepsi Center, The Big Tent will be a 9,000-square foot, two-story, air-conditioned structure offering work space for journalists, bloggers and new media, as well as the Digg Stage with events that will be open to the public, and a YouTube area where people can record comments and ideas to broadcast to the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Big Tent will also host sponsored happy hours each day from 4:00 to 5:00 p.m., followed by live coverage of every minute of the Democratic National Convention until 9:00 p.m. each night. &amp;nbsp;When the Convention shuts down each day, The Big Tent will still be going with late-night entertainment, including concerts and films. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a partisan-agnostic affair, so bloggers of all political persuasions, and even non-political bloggers, are invited to participate. The cost is the ridiculously low $100 which includes food and beer for the duration of the convention (courtesy of several yet-to-be-announced sponsors). Space is limited, so anyone wishing to attend should hurry and apply. Also be aware that Denver is facing a serious shortage of hotel space, so expect to pay top dollar for any available space. This shortage has reached crisis proportions, so fair warning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But everyone who can make it, this will be &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; hangout. I&#39;ve got convention blogger passes, but other than Obama&#39;s acceptance speech, I plan to be at the Big Tent living it up. I can&#39;t wait to announce the concerts. It&#39;s going to include some bad-ass names, and bloggers will have the chance to meet with and interview many of the party&#39;s top VIPs, as the Big Tent will be part of their media rounds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if you&#39;re a citizen-media type (blogger, v-logger, whatever), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigtentdenver.org/index.cfm&quot;&gt;submit your registration&lt;/a&gt; and join the fun..&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>House and Senate Roundup, 6/26</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/1331/65424</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CO-Sen&lt;/strong&gt;: So it seems that Bob Schaffer, slipping in the polls and trailing badly in the money race, has turned to his Ukrainian pals for help.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During his days in Congress, Schaffer was one of the Ukraine&#39;s chief American benefactors (when he wasn&#39;t taking Abramoff-sponsored junkets to the Marianas islands, that is). At one point, in fact, he remarked that he was able to do more with less effort for the Ukraine than for his own constituents (a statement which may come back to haunt him, as he is, after all, running to be the Senator from the fine state of Colorado).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ever-vigilant DSCC, of course, did not let this opportunity slide:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/b_9d2HPq9Is&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; name=&quot;movie&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/b_9d2HPq9Is&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bob Schaffer&#39;s response to this is, of course, to try and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollcall.com/issues/hoh/index.html?page=2&quot;&gt;make our snarking even easier&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the ad ran just before a public showing of Kiev-Schaffer love: A fundraiser is scheduled at the Women&amp;rsquo;s National Republican Club in New York tonight for Schaffer, sponsored by the Ukrainian-Americans for Bob Schaffer 2008. The Ukraine-themed blog cybercossack.com is even promoting it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Through our common efforts, with our &amp;lsquo;Evening&amp;rsquo; being a good first step, we can help ensure that Bob Schaffer will have a chance to become &amp;lsquo;Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s best friend in the US Senate Chamber,&amp;rsquo;&quot; the site reads.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just too easy for the other side to take another jab. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure how I feel about &quot;CyberCossacks&quot; supporting Bob Schaffer...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Good for Bob Schaffer,&quot; one Democratic strategist quipped. &quot;This will surely ... stop his poll numbers from sinking any further.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actually...it won&#39;t. Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=2352&quot;&gt;Quinnipiac&#39;s latest&lt;/a&gt;, anyway, which shows Mark Udall defeating Schaffer by double digits:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Udall&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(D) 48 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schaffer&lt;/strong&gt; (R) 38&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right in line with recent polls from Rasmussen and the DCCC giving Udall a nine-point lead. Udall is starting to pull away with this race, as we hoped and expected he would.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR-Sen&lt;/strong&gt;: The Oregon Chamber of Commerce is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1214445329183780.xml&amp;amp;coll=7&quot;&gt;out with a poll&lt;/a&gt; (they like to do that, it seems) on the Senate race, and it ain&#39;t good news for Gordon Smith.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The poll, which was conducted prior to the withdrawal of independent candidate John Frohnmayer, showed Smith leading his Democratic challenger Jeff Merkley by four points, 38% to 34%, with Frohnmayer picking up 14%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a surprisingly strong showing for Frohnmayer, and a weak showing for Smith. Merkley is about where you would expect him to be in a poll showing 14% support for an indie, but Smith, as an incumbent, must be a bit concerned about his 38% showing. Even if &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Frohnmayer&#39;s supporters in this poll went for Smith, which of course they won&#39;t, the two-term incumbent would still only be at 52%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TX-Sen&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texaslyceum.org/media/staticContent/PubCon_Journals/2008/National%20Summary%20_day%202_%20final.pdf&quot;&gt;Big John is in Big Trouble&lt;/a&gt;, according to a Texas Lyceum poll that gives him a slim, slim edge over Rick Noriega:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornyn&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;(R) 38 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noriega&lt;/strong&gt; (D) 36&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am more than a bit skeptical of this poll, however. Even the worst polling for Cornyn has had him in the upper 40s (in May, Research 2000 gave him a 48-44 lead, Rasmussen a 48-44 lead, Baselice a 49-33 lead). The better polling for Cornyn has had him in the low 50s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As ridiculous and unpopular as Cornyn is, I just don&#39;t see any way he&#39;s below 40% reelect. Maybe if you just took the &quot;definitely will vote for Cornyn&quot; voters...but if that&#39;s the case, and leaners weren&#39;t pushed at all, I can&#39;t see how Noriega gets 36% to Cornyn&#39;s 38.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So take this one with a heavy grain of salt. Still, it&#39;s worth noting, at least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GA-Sen&lt;/strong&gt;: Democratic Senate candidate Jim Martin is on the air:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/zWYYIYUFM0Q&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; name=&quot;movie&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/zWYYIYUFM0Q&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NJ-Sen&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicmind.fdu.edu/senate0806/&quot;&gt;Substantial lead&lt;/a&gt; for Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey, though the poll looks bizarre: 45% for Lautenberg, 28% for Republican Dick Zimmer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the best news for Lautenberg:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A whopping 44% of New Jersey voters say they&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate; another 29% say that while they have heard of him, they have no opinion of him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is in spite of the fact that Zimmer has run statewide before, albeit 12 years ago, in 1996, when he lost his Senate race to Robert Torricelli.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;House Races&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY-13&lt;/strong&gt;: I don&#39;t even know what to say other than the plain fact: yet another presumptive GOP nominee for this seat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/nyregion/26staten.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=nyregion&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;is out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;They had also considered Lisa Giovinazzo, a lawyer and part-time anchor at the cable channel NY1 News. But on Wednesday, Ms. Giovinazzo said she would not be a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Craig Eaton, the party chairman in Brooklyn, has spoken favorably about the possibility of a bid by Paul Atanasio, a retired investment banker who lives in Brooklyn and is a member of the Conservative Party. Mr. Atanasio was involved in a nepotism controversy involving a city agency nine years ago, but Mr. Eaton said he did not think that would hurt his chances. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Atanasio is the Conservative Party&#39;s candidate. He is not a registered Republican.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The GOP&#39;s search for a candidate here has gone from hilarious, to ridiculous, to pathetic, to tragic (with the untimely passing of Frank Powers). At this point, I have no idea what to call it, except for a likely Democratic pickup.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CA-04&lt;/strong&gt;: Conservative Icon Tom McClintock has taken up recreational flip-flopping. In this case, he was for campaigning with disgraced Rep. John Doolittle before he was against it, and now he is for it again, though don&#39;t hold him to that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politickerca.com/alexisenstadt/1210/doolittle-campaign-mcclintock&quot;&gt;June 16&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about doing a couple of events and we&amp;rsquo;re putting them together,&quot; said Doolittle spokesman Dan Blankeburg. Blankeburg declined to provide any further details, adding that the two sides had only talked in what he called &quot;conceptual terms.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politickerca.com/alexisenstadt/1216/doolittle-prepares-exit-stage-complex-legacy-place&quot;&gt;June 17&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;While a Doolittle aide indicated that the congressman was prepared to support and campaign for Republican state Sen. Tom McClintock to succeed him at the end of the term, McClintock&amp;rsquo;s side, which has embraced the outsider Republican mantle, has not rushed to embrace Doolittle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&amp;rsquo;re running as an outsider why would you want anyone&amp;rsquo;s endorsement?&quot; asked John Feliz, a McClintock consultant, when asked if the campaign would be receiving Doolittle&amp;rsquo;s stamp of approval. &quot;This election is about a new direction for our party. You might even say change.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollcall.com/news/26114-1.html&quot;&gt;June 20&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any plans to meet with Doolittle next week and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any plans to campaign with Doolittle,&quot; McClintock said by phone from Sacramento. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtdemocrat.com/story.php?id=101.5&quot;&gt;June 22&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Fourth Congressional District Republican nominee Tom McClintock will meet with Rep. John Doolittle, R-Rocklin, next week to discuss his campaign, a Doolittle spokesman said Wednesday...&amp;rsquo;John agreed to introduce Tom to capital caucus members, who have been loyal supporters of John&amp;rsquo;s for his entire career,&amp;rsquo; said Dan Blankenburg, Doolittle&amp;rsquo;s deputy chief of staff. &amp;lsquo;He also offered to be a liaison to Tom for local government officials...&amp;rsquo; &quot;It&amp;rsquo;s been Charlie&amp;rsquo;s strategy to paint me as a Doolittle prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233;,&quot; he (McClintock) said. &quot;He&amp;rsquo;s going to have a tough time. Remember that practically all the Doolittle staff was on the opposite side during this primary. But I certainly do welcome the intimate knowledge Doolittle has with the district.&amp;rsquo;&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_158/atr/26236-1.html?user_id=80059435&quot;&gt;And now&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;State Sen. Tom McClintock (R), running for the 4th district seat being vacated by Rep. John Doolittle (R), said Tuesday that he personally killed a meeting between him and the Congressman that had been scheduled by his campaign.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our campaign was making some arrangements, and I put a stop to that,&quot; McClintock said Tuesday during a brief telephone interview while he was in Washington, D.C., for meetings and to raise money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I cannot wait for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TX-22, AZ-08&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.committee4spaceadvocacy.org/Endorsements.html&quot;&gt;The Committee for the Advocacy of Space Exploration&lt;/a&gt; endorsed Nick Lampson and Gabrielle Giffords yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s nice for Giffords, whose husband is an astronaut, but it is particularly good for Lampson, whose district includes the famous Johnson Space Center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lampson&#39;s opponent, Pete Olson, is also a strong supporter of space exploration. But he lacks Lampson&#39;s long experience and track record on the issue. Furthermore, because he will likely be named Chair of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Lampson will be in a much stronger position to positively influence space policy than Olson would be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a critical endorsement at all, but Lampson needs all the help he can get in his race.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO-06&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey, remember how a whole raft of Republican leaders were spreading that big lie about how China was drilling off the coast of Florida?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of those illustrious folks was Congressman Sam Graves, notorious hater of &quot;San Francisco values&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/sb3-ENB6gY0&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; name=&quot;movie&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/sb3-ENB6gY0&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO-09&lt;/strong&gt;: Our dear friends at the Club for Growth are picking their poison in the Republican primary to succeed Rep. Kenny Hulshof. They&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_159/atr/26298-1.html&quot;&gt;narrowed their choices&lt;/a&gt; to state Rep. Bob Onder, the GOP frontrunner, and fellow Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O, Club for Growth, why have you forsaken Brock Olivo?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LA-07&lt;/strong&gt;: This was expected, but State Sen. Don Cravins Jr. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_159/atr/26283-1.html&quot;&gt;is officially in&lt;/a&gt; to challenge Rep. Charles Boustany, in an R+7.4 seat that belonged to a Democrat until recently (former Rep. Chris John, who retired to run for Senate).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;State Sen. Don Cravins Jr. (D) announced Wednesday that he will challenge second-term Rep. Charles Boustany (R) in the Bayou State&amp;rsquo;s southwest 7th district.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The freshman state Senator, who also served one term in the Louisiana House of Representatives, enters the race with the vocal support of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, whose leaders he met with on a visit to Washington, D.C., earlier this month. DCCC officials are calling Cravins a strong candidate who is a good fit for the district.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 7th is a conservative district that voted for President Bush in 2004 by a 21-point margin, but it had long been represented by moderate Democrats before 2004. The district is about one-quarter black and also has a large number of Catholics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cravins enters the race fairly late, but he should be a pretty strong candidate and will put this race on the national radar. Credit the DCCC and the Louisiana Democratic party for putting the full-court press on in a red state, particularly if we can find a good challenger to Rep. Rodney Alexander as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<description>&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Hmm, what&#39;s up with Wexler&#39;s sudden high-visibility, like the ads on this site, his new book, and so on? Is he running for governor in 2010?

On March 13 the American Spectator broadened the term to cover all &quot;conservative supporters&quot; of the Democratic presidential candidate. Their ranks, though growing, feature few famous people. But looming on the horizon are two big potential Obamacons: Colin Powell and Chuck Hagel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither Powell, first-term secretary of state for George W. Bush, nor Hagel, retiring after two terms as a U.S. senator from Nebraska, has endorsed Obama. Hagel probably never will. Powell probably will enter Obama&#39;s camp at a time of his own choosing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>Hey Senators! Raise Your Hand if You&#39;ve Read the FISA Bill</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/135827/968</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been some excellent analysis of the FISA bill around the blogosphere. I particularly like &lt;a href=&quot;http://technosailor.com/2008/06/22/ill-see-your-wiretap-and-raise-you-weapons-of-mass-destruction-fisa-2008-analysis/&quot;&gt;Technosailor&lt;/a&gt; for a clear, concise, and lay person&#39;s view. For the lawyers, and people who&#39;ve been deep in the weeds on this legislation enough to have a solid grasp of the terminology, Balkinization has featured a &lt;a href=&quot;http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/06/guide-to-new-fisa-bill-part-i.html&quot;&gt;series of posts&lt;/a&gt; by David Kris, and an excellent summation and response by &lt;a href=&quot;http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/06/fisa-fix-follow-ups.html&quot;&gt;Marty Lederman&lt;/a&gt;. Julian Sanchez has an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=democrats_capitulate_on_fisa&quot;&gt;political overview&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, as does &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_06/013956.php&quot;&gt;Kevin Drum&lt;/a&gt;. And it goes without saying, everything of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/&quot;&gt;Glenn Greenwald&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They all detail some of the main points, also included on Sen. Feingold&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://feingold.senate.gov/issues_fisafacts.html&quot;&gt;Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;. Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/23/165958/291/268/540794&quot;&gt;basic summary&lt;/a&gt;, but all of the above resources provide the depth of what&#39;s really wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On retroactive immunity, the bill virtually guarantees it, despite the fig-leaf of a district court review.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In their infinite wisdom, Hoyer and the negotiators set the bill to sunset in the fall of 2012--just before the next presidential election. This bad bill should not be in effect for that long, and shouldn&#39;t be subject to election year politics, again.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The protections against reverse targeting are inadequte--the guidelines for targeting someone in the U.S. are not subject to judicial review, or the requirement of a court order for that surveillance.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The bill doesn&#39;t prohibit bulk collection--&quot;the collection of all international communications into and out of the U.S. to a whole continent or even the entire world.&quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The bill contains a far too broad &quot;exigency&quot; exception to the idea of FISC exclusivity--the Attorney General or DNI can certify that they don&#39;t have time to get a court order.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Even if the FISC determines after that fact that the surveillance violated the law, the government can still keep and use any of the information it obtains under those illegal warrants.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The bill doesn&#39;t provide additional checks and balances for Americans at home whose international communications are obtained because they are communicating with someone overseas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, here&#39;s my favorite provision included in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/56332p&quot;&gt;the legislation&lt;/a&gt; [warning, that&#39;s a 114 page pdf], Sec. 110, part 4 of Title I (p. 81):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;SEC. 110. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;DEFINITIONS.&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[snip]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(4) WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION.&amp;mdash;Such section 101 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;(p) &amp;lsquo;Weapon of mass destruction&amp;rsquo; means&amp;mdash; &lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;(1) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas device that is designed, intended, or has the capability to cause a mass casualty incident; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;(2) any weapon that is designed, intended, or has the capability to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons through the release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;(3) any weapon involving a biological agent, toxin, or vector (as such terms are defined in section 178 of title 18, United States Code) that is designed, intended, or has the capability to cause death, illness, or serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons; or &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;(4) any weapon that is designed, intended, or has the capability to release radiation or radioactivity causing death, illness, or serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wonder how many Senators blithely casting their lot with this bill realize that they&#39;re redefining warfare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s every chance that the immunity provisions in the bill are unconstitutional. But Congress doesn&#39;t know because no Judiciary Committee hearings were held to vet that portion of the bill. Nor were any Defense Committee hearings held to vet this WMD provision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what happens when the oversight muscle of Congress becomes so atrophed. They don&#39;t even conduct oversight of themselves. And they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re voting for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, it looks as though Senate leadership is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasdaq.net/publicpages/NewsDetailPublic.aspx?symbol=&amp;amp;storyId=20080626\ACQDJON200806261315DOWJONESDJONLINE000684.htm&quot;&gt;trying to delay&lt;/a&gt; the vote on the bill until after recess. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Durbin, D-Ill., told reporters Thursday that Democratic leaders plan to wait until July take up the bill, which rewrites the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Durbin said that Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., a leading opponent of the bill, has asked that the Senate delay consideration of the bill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps our Senators can take this opportunity to spend some time actually reading what they&#39;re going to be voting on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: The link to Sen. Feingold&#39;s fact sheet was an old one. It has been updated with the correct link.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>AFL-CIO Endorses Obama</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/132749/037</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/06/26/afl-cio-endorses-obama-launches-meet-barack-obama/&quot;&gt;AFL-CIO endorsed Obama&lt;/a&gt; today:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO today endorsed Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) for president.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO General Board, which voted to endorse Obama, includes presidents of all 56 unions in the AFL-CIO, as well as Executive Council members and representatives of state and local federations, trade departments and constituency groups. The General Board votes by per capita membership. In conjunction with the endorsement, the AFL-CIO launched a new website: Meet Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In its endorsement statement, the General Board noted that Sen. Barack Obama &quot;secured the nomination of his party in a campaign that has energized millions of Americans and spoken to the hopes and dreams of people from every corner of our nation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;His leadership can re-engage disenfranchised Americans and bring our country together. Sen. Obama has advocated a change of direction for our nation that mirrors the priorities of the labor movement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In announcing the endorsement today, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said, &quot;Barack Obama has proven from his days as an organizer, to his time in the Senate and his historic run for the presidency, that he&amp;rsquo;s leading the fight to turn around America.&quot; Saying, as a champion for working families, Obama&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;knows what it&amp;rsquo;s going to take to create an economy that works for everyone, not just Big Oil, Big Pharma, the insurance companies, the giant mortgage lenders, speculators and the very wealthy. We&amp;rsquo;re proud to stand with Sen. Obama to help our nation chart a course that will improve life for generations of working people and our children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama has vowed to fight for working families and for an economy that works for all&amp;mdash;and he has the record to prove it. As a church-based community organizer, Obama assisted those affected by closing steel mills. As a state senator in Illinois, he sponsored legislation to expand health care and protect overtime pay. As a U.S. senator, Obama has earned a 98 percent lifetime rating from the AFL-CIO. And all along, he&amp;rsquo;s marched on picket lines and rallied with striking workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO also launched its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aflcio.org/issues/politics/obama.cfm&quot;&gt;Meet Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; website to join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aflcio.org/issues/politics/mccain.cfm&quot;&gt;McCain Revealed&lt;/a&gt; site started in March, when it announced plans for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/3/13/10914/9762&quot;&gt;$53.4 million&lt;/a&gt; in election expenditures. &amp;nbsp;The two largest affiliates of the AFL-CIO--AFSCME and the American Federation of Teachers--supported Hillary Clinton in the primary. &amp;nbsp;This endorsement and commitment to educating and mobilizing their members demonstrates that they wasted no time in unifying in support of Barack Obama and getting to work contributing to a Democratic win in November.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>CT-04: AFL-CIO Endorses Himes</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/25/162534/743</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Just days after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/23/12367/2534/386/540652&quot;&gt;Alaska AFL-CIO&lt;/a&gt; endorsed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actblue.com/page/orangetoblue?refcode=HimesAFL-CIO&quot;&gt;Orange to Blue&lt;/a&gt; candidate Mark Begich, fellow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actblue.com/page/orangetoblue?refcode=HimesAFL-CIO&quot;&gt;Orange to Blue&lt;/a&gt; candidate Jim Himes has been endorsed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.himesforcongress.com/press_release/himes_earns_afl_cio_endorsement&quot;&gt;Connecticut AFL-CIO&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Jim really understands the issues facing working families,&quot; said James Parent, Connecticut State Council of Machinists President and AFL-CIO Vice President. &quot;Jim knows that we need to create good jobs and fight for the manufacturing jobs that we still have, to find real answers on healthcare and education, and to get out of Iraq. I&#39;m convinced Jim will be a tremendous ally for working families, and we look forward to doing all we can to get him elected.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Connecticut&#39;s union density is lower than Alaska&#39;s, but this is an especially significant endorsement given his opponent. As DavidNYC&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/19/14152/2536/370/537617&quot;&gt;introductory post&lt;/a&gt; on Himes laid out, a number of Democrats and progressive groups have been giving protective cover to Republican incumbent Chris Shays. The League of Conservation Voters and the Human Rights Campaign have endorsed Shays. They would argue that he&#39;s a moderate Republican -- but should an LCV-endorsed candidate turn around and support coastal oil drilling? What kind of moderation is that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The LCV and HRC might have gotten played on this one thanks to their desire to appear non-partisan damaging the causes they exist to support, but the Connecticut AFL-CIO obviously knows better and won&#39;t be supporting someone like Shays just because he only pisses on them 57% of the time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aflcio.org/issues/legislativealert/votes/upload/house_final_07.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) instead of 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jim Himes is fighting a tough battle to take out the last House Republican in New England, and unfortunately, he&#39;s having to fight against people who should be on his side. But organized labor has his back, and, through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actblue.com/page/orangetoblue?refcode=HimesAFL-CIO&quot;&gt;Orange to Blue&lt;/a&gt; list, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>

<title>SCOTUS Overturns Millionaire&#39;s Amendment</title>
<link>http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/26/101541/622</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Remember the Millionaire&#39;s Amendment? &amp;nbsp;Basically, it says that if a candidate self-funds his House or Senate campaign beyond a certain level (and the math is complicated) and makes the race less competitive, the challenger can start raising funds at twice or even three times ($6900/election) the contribution limits otherwise applicable, and the self-funder becomes subject to various mandatory disclosure requirements regarding his use of his own funds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://electionlawblog.org/archives/fecvdavis.pdf&quot;&gt;based on today&#39;s 5-4 Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; authored by Justice Alito, it&#39;s just a memory now. &amp;nbsp;Since I can&#39;t imagine Congress acting anytime soon, in the 2008 cycle millionaire self-funding candidates can spend to their heart&#39;s content without there being any recourse for their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Essentially, what killed this law was that the raised contribution limits applied were only available to the challenger, and the Court found this to be unduly discriminatory: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Buckley, we soundly rejected a cap on a candidate&amp;rsquo;s expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech. We held that a &quot;candidate . . . has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election&quot; and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes &quot;a substantial,&quot; &quot;clea[r]&quot; and &quot;direc[t]&quot; restraint on that right. &amp;nbsp;We found that the cap at issue was not justified by &quot;[t]he primary governmental interest&quot; proffered in its defense, i.e., &quot;the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process.&quot; Far from preventing these evils, &quot;the use of personal funds,&quot; we observed, &quot;reduces the candidate&amp;rsquo;s dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which . . . contribution limitations are directed.&quot;. We also rejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be justified on the ground that it served &quot;[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office.&quot; This putative interest, we noted, was &quot;clearly not sufficient to justify the . . . infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.&quot; &amp;nbsp;Buckley&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is instructive. &lt;strong&gt;While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate&amp;rsquo;s expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right. &lt;/strong&gt;Section 319(a) requires a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations. Many candidates who can afford to make large personal expenditures to support their campaigns may choose to do so despite &amp;sect;319(a), but they must shoulder a special potentially significant burden if they make that choice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority determined that &quot;leveling the playing field&quot; was not a legitimate reason to burden that First Amendment right: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The argument that a candidate&amp;rsquo;s speech may be restricted in order to &quot;level electoral opportunities&quot; has ominous implications because it would permit Congress to arrogate the voters&amp;rsquo; authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office. See Bellotti, supra, at 791&amp;#8211;792 (&quot;[T]he people in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments&quot; and &quot;may consider, in making their judgment, the source and credibility of the advocate&quot;). &lt;strong&gt;Different candidates have different strengths.&lt;/strong&gt; Some are wealthy; others have wealthy supporters who are willing to make large contributions. Some are celebrities; some have the benefit of a well-known family name. &lt;strong&gt;Leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, &amp;sect;2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters&amp;rsquo; choices.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens writes for the four dissenters, who maintain that the Millionaire&#39;s Amendment reflected a reasonable choice for Congress to make: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thrust of Davis&amp;rsquo; First Amendment challenge is that by relaxing the contribution limits applicable to the opponent of a self-funding candidate, the Millionaire&amp;rsquo;s Amendment punishes the candidate who chooses to self-fund. Extrapolating from the zero-sum nature of a political race, Davis insists that any benefit conferred upon a self-funder&amp;rsquo;s opponent thereby works a detriment to the self-funding candidate. Accordingly, he argues, the scheme burdens the self-funding candidate&amp;rsquo;s First Amendment right to speak freely and to participate fully in the political process. But &lt;strong&gt;Davis cannot show that the Millionaire&amp;rsquo;s Amendment causes him -- or any other self-funding candidate -- any First Amendment injury whatsoever. The Millionaire&amp;rsquo;s Amendment quiets no speech at all. &lt;/strong&gt;On the contrary, it does no more than assist the opponent of a self-funding candidate in his attempts to make his voice heard; this amplification in no way mutes the voice of the millionaire, who remains able to speak as loud and as long as he likes in support of his campaign. &lt;strong&gt;Enhancing the speech of the millionaire&amp;rsquo;s opponent, far from contravening the First Amendment, actually advances its core principles. &lt;/strong&gt;If only one candidate can make himself heard, the voter&amp;rsquo;s ability to make an informed choice is impaired. And the self-funding candidate&amp;rsquo;s ability to engage meaningfully in the political process is in no way undermined by this provision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Minimizing the effect of concentrated wealth on our political process, and the concomitant interest in addressing the dangers that attend the perception that political power can be purchased, are, therefore, sufficiently weighty objectives to justify significant congressional action. And, not only was Congress motivated by proper and weighty goals in crafting the Millionaire&amp;rsquo;s Amendment, the details of the scheme it devised are genuinely responsive to the problems it identified. The statute&amp;rsquo;s &quot;Opposition Personal Funds Amount&quot; formula permits a self-funding candidate to spend as much money as he wishes, while taking into account fundraising by the relevant campaigns; it thereby ensures that a candidate who happens to enjoy a significant fundraising advantage against a self-funding opponent does not reap a windfall as a result of the enhanced contribution limits. Rather, the self-funder&amp;rsquo;s opponent may avail himself of the enhanced contribution limits only until parity is achieved, at which point he becomes again ineligible for contributions above the normal maximum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems uncontroversial that &quot;there is no good reason to allow disparities in wealth to be translated into disparities in political power.&lt;/strong&gt; A well-functioning democracy distinguishes between market processes of purchase and sale on the one hand and political processes of voting and reasongiving on the other.&quot; Sunstein, Political Equality and Unintended Consequences, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1390 (1994). In light of that clear truth, Congress&amp;rsquo; carefully crafted attempt to reduce the distinct advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates for congressional office does not offend the First Amendment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, Justice Stevens offers thoughts of his own, thankfully shared by none of his fellow dissenting justices, beacuse this is just thoroughly repugnant to the First Amendment: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my view, a number of purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign. For one, such limitations would &quot;free candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising.&quot; Moreover, the imposition of reasonable limitations would likely have the salutary effect of improving the quality of the exposition of ideas. After all, orderly debate is always more enlightening than a shouting match that awards points on the basis of decibels rather than reasons. Quantity limitations are commonplace in any number of other contexts in which high-value speech occurs. Litigants in this Court pressing issues of the utmost importance to the Nation are allowed only a fixed time for oral debate and a maximum number of pages for written argument. As listeners and as readers, judges need time to reflect on the merits of an issue; repetitious arguments are disfavored and are usually especially unpersuasive. Indeed, experts in the art of advocacy agree that &quot;lawyers go on for too long, and when &amp;nbsp;they do it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help their case.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt; It seems to me that Congress is entitled to make the judgment that voters deserve the same courtesy and the same opportunity to reflect as judges; flooding the airwaves with slogans and sound-bites may well do more to obscure the issues than to enlighten listeners. &lt;/strong&gt;At least in the context of elections, the notion that rules limiting the quantity of speech are just as offensive to the First Amendment as rules limiting the content of speech is plainly incorrect. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may not have been a perfect law -- and it&#39;s certainly easy enough to raise the limits symmetrically instead -- but from a political perspective I worry about the implications of changing the rules with about four months to go before Election Day. &amp;nbsp; After all, part of how Barack Obama was able to remain competitive his 2004 Senate primary against Blair Hull -- who spent $28,000,000+ of his own money on the race -- is that Obama was able to secure larger checks from his supporters. &amp;nbsp; (It also, to be sure, aided Joe Lieberman in his race against Ned Lamont.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/us/politics/26recruit.html?_r=1&amp;amp;hp=&amp;amp;adxnnl=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&amp;amp;adxnnlx=1214496411-tDuyxTaYYm4Gw7s/8+BEmg&quot;&gt;2008&#39;s candidates&lt;/a&gt; will have to find other ways to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The more ominous implication is what this may mean for public financing systems, which after all are premised on government&#39;s ability to institute measures to level the electoral playing field. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://electionlawblog.org/archives/011095.html&quot;&gt;Rick Hasen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com/news.html?AID=1290&quot;&gt;Bob Bauer&lt;/a&gt; have more.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
