<p>
Ads are officially coming to Snapchat, in a form the company says is not "targeted," but Snapchat's own terms of service suggest it could do something very much like that.</p><p>
The first ad will appear this weekend in the U.S., in the "recent updates" section of the app. That means it won't be pushed to users like a personal message, and users can choose whether to open it or not. It will disappear after it is viewed or within 24 hours, the same way the "Stories" feature works, the company <a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/100255857340/advertising-on-snapchat">said</a> Friday in a blog post.</p><p>
The company did not say who the first advertiser would be, and a spokeswoman declined to comment further.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835229/snapchat-rolls-out-non-creepy-ads-that-still-might-get-creepy.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

IBM will sell the semiconductor technologies unit that makes its Power processors to GlobalFoundries, paying the chip manufacturer about $1.3 billion to take two factories off its hands in a move to save money.</p><p>
Like many old-school tech companies, IBM has struggled to find its feet in a world where mobile devices and cloud services are becoming increasingly important. The company is under pressure to cut costs as well as find ways to halt falling revenues.</p><p>
The deal with GlobalFoundries and the sale of its server business to Lenovo falls into the first category. In a bid a to get a better foothold in the growing mobile enterprise sector, the company announced a partnership with Apple in July. As part of the deal IBM will develop iOS apps that integrate with its big data and analytics services and promote iPhones and iPads.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835479/components-processors/globalfoundries-to-take-over-ibms-semiconductor-unit-in-13b-deal.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

When demand exceeds the supply of available IT talent, many companies are using contractors to help fill the gaps. IT contractors provide manpower when workloads spike and can bring key expertise and skills to a team. (See related story, <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2824528/careers/life-as-an-it-contractor.html">Life as an IT contractor</a>)</p><p>
Across all fields (not just IT), independent workers are on the rise, according to MBO Partners, which provides back-office services to self-employed professionals. The number of independent workers is forecast to reach 40 million in 2019, up from 30 million today. Over the last four years, the independent workforce has grown 12.5% -- greatly outpacing the 1.1% growth in the overall U.S. labor force, MBO asserts.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835975/16-tips-for-thriving-as-an-it-contractor.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]>(Insider Story)</description>

Hosted service vendor Telco Systems is hoping to make it easier for businesses to buy cloud-based routers and firewalls, but the company first has to convince service providers it's a good idea.</p><p>
Virtualization has already changed how enterprises build and manage their IT infrastructure, and now mobile operators are looking at doing the same thing, and vendors are re-architecting their products. Two areas that are ripe for moving from hardware to hosted environments are security and network equipment, according to telecom vendor Telco Systems.</p><p>
The purported advantages to businesses are the same as with other cloud-based services. IT departments at businesses of all sizes won't in this case have to install and manage routers and firewalls, an increasingly complicated task as both product categories are becoming more advanced.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835683/telco-systems-lays-groundwork-for-fewer-management-worries-with-virtual-routers-firewalls.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Ethernet's future is about much more than the next top speed: The engineers charting a path for the ubiquitous networking protocol are looking at several new versions to serve a variety of applications.</p><p>
At a meeting last Thursday of the Ethernet Alliance, an industry group that promotes IEEE Ethernet standards, three major new projects were up for discussion.</p><p>
To meet immediate demands in cloud data centers, there's a standard in the works for 25Gbps (bits per second). For the kinds of traffic expected in those clouds a few years from now, experts are already discussing a 50Gbps specification.

Dropbox's file storage service was used for a tricky phishing attack, although the service was quick to shut down it down, according to Symantec.</p><p>
The security vendor said it detected a batch of phishing emails advising recipients that they've been sent a large file and included a link to Dropbox-hosted page.</p><p>
"The email claims the document can be viewed by clicking on the link included in the message," wrote Nick Johnston of Symantec in a <a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dropbox-users-targeted-phishing-scam-hosted-dropbox">blog post</a>. "However, the link opens a fake Dropbox login page, hosted on Dropbox itself."</p><p>
By hosting the fake login page on Dropbox, the scammers gain some benefits over hosting it on a random, strange-looking domain name. The phishing page is contained within Dropbox's user content domain, similar to shared photos or files, Johnston wrote.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835166/dropbox-used-for-convincing-phishing-attack.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Under pressure to boost margins, IBM is set to make what it calls a "major business announcement" Monday morning, an indication that it has finalized a deal to transfer chip-making operations to GlobalFoundries.</p><p>
IBM announced Sunday that it would be issuing its quarterly earnings statement early Monday, moving it up from its previous schedule, timed for after the close of markets. The company said it would also separately make a business announcement.</p><p>
IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is looking for ways to increase margins as revenue growth slows while it transitions to new technology and services offerings. One way to do this is to shed less profitable parts of the business.

President Barack Obama issued an executive order on Friday to have secure chip-and-PIN technology embedded into government-issued credit and debit cards as part of a broader move aimed at stemming payment data breaches.</p><p>
Under the order, government-issued cards that transmit federal benefits such as Social Security will have microchips embedded instead of the usual magnetic strips, as well as associated PINs like those typically used for consumer debit cards. A replacement program for the cards is set to begin on Jan. 1 of next year, with the goal to have more than 1 million such cards issued by the end of the year, Obama said at the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to a press release.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835226/obama-orders-chip-and-pin-for-government-credit-cards.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>
Apple's iPad Air 2 is faster than its predecessors thanks to the A8X chip, which could pave the way for the company to put its homegrown silicon in large-screen tablets, TVs, cars and even laptops.</p><p>
The A8X, an ARM architecture chip built by Apple, has enough horsepower for the company to bring 4K screens, better cameras and advanced sensors to its tablets, industry observers said. The 64-bit chip was specially designed for the new tablet and is not simply an adaptation of its cousin, the A8, which is in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.</p><p>
Apple doesn't share information about future devices, but there have been rumors about a larger iPad and an Apple TV set-top box. The company is also chasing opportunities in the automotive and health markets.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835567/apples-a8x-chip-opens-door-to-new-devices.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

The U.S. tech industry scored a victory this week when President Barack Obama nominated former Google lawyer Michelle Lee to lead the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p><p>
After the White House's announcement Thursday, several tech groups praised the nomination. Lee, who currently serves as the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/about/bios/bio_lee.jsp">USPTO's deputy director</a>, is a popular choice in the technology industry as IT companies have major rifts about patent policy with small inventors and pharmaceutical firms.</p><p>
In general, the U.S. tech industry has pushed for legislation that would make it more difficult for patent holders -- including patent-licensing companies -- to sue for patent infringement, while many small inventors and pharmaceutical companies have resisted calls to weaken patent protections.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835555/tech-industry-applauds-obama-nominee-for-patent-office.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Users who are careful to download files only from trusted websites may be tricked by a new type of Web vulnerability: this one cons them into downloading malicious executable files that are not actually hosted where they appear to be.</p><p>
The attack has been dubbed reflected file download (RFD) and is somewhat similar in concept to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks where users are tricked to click on specifically crafted links to legitimate sites that force their browsers to execute rogue code contained in the URLs themselves.</p><p>
In the case of RFD, the victim's browser does not execute code, but offers a file for download with an executable extension like .bat or .cmd that contains shell commands or script files like JS, VBS, WSH that will be executed through the Windows-based script host (Wscript.exe). The contents of the file are passed through the attacker-generated URL that the user clicks on, the website reflecting the input back to the browser as a file download.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835091/new-web-flaw-enables-powerful-social-engineering-attacks.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>
A new technique that allows attackers to hide encrypted malicious Android applications inside images could be used to evade detection by antivirus products and possibly Google Play's own malware scanner.</p><p>
The attack was developed by Axelle Apvrille, a researcher at Fortinet, and reverse engineer Ange Albertini, who presented their proof-of-concept at the Black Hat Europe security conference in Amsterdam on Thursday.</p><p>
It's based on a technique devised by Albertini dubbed AngeCryption that allows controlling both the input and the output of a file encryption operation using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) by taking advantage of the properties of some file formats that allow files to remain valid despite having junk data appended to them.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835276/technique-allows-attackers-to-hide-android-malware-in-images.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>
Samsung Electronics hopes its latest Chromebook 2 will reaffirm its commitment to PCs in the U.S., especially after a surprising decision last month to stop selling laptops in Europe.</p><p>
The latest Chromebook 2 NP900X3E-A02US, announced Friday, has an 11.6-inch screen and weighs 1.2 kilograms. Starting at $249.99, it is also Samsung's least expensive Chromebook 2 model.</p><p>
The model will ship next week in the U.S. The laptop offers nine hours of battery life and has 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM.</p><p>
Chromebooks are lightweight, low-cost laptops for those who do most of their computing online. The PCs run Google's Chrome OS, and most applications require wireless connectivity. Google is making more offline applications available in an effort to make Chromebooks full-fledged competitors to Windows PCs.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835217/laptop-computers/samsung-sticks-to-us-pc-market-with-24999-chromebook-2.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>
New Apple iPads allow users to choose between data plans offered by different cellular carriers without having to obtain a separate SIM from each. But that's only the beginning as embedded SIMs like the new Apple SIM have the potential to change the way all devices connect to cellular networks.</p><p>
The new iPad Air 2 may be thinner and faster than its predecessor, but the introduction of Apple's own SIM card is the improvement users should be the happiest about. The so-called Apple SIM lets users choose from short-term plans from carriers in the U.S. and U.K. right on the cellular versions of the iPad Air 2 and mini 3.</p><p>
"So whenever you need it, you can choose the plan that works best for you -- with no long-term commitments. And when you travel, you may also be able to choose a data plan from a local carrier for the duration of your trip," Apple said on its website.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2835047/apple-sim-has-potential-but-widespread-changes-will-take-time.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
