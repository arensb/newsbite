2013-12-18  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@downspout.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.css: Buttons should have Roboto, not
	Roboto Thin font. Missing semicolon.

2013-12-17  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@downspout.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.php: Add class to link, so we can find
	it later and remove it.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: If the feed has no URL, then don't
	present a link.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: Handle pathological case where a
	feed has no title.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: If there's no feed icon, remove the
	<img> DOM node: it's ugly in some browsers (Safari).

2013-12-13  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@downspout.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/index.css: Minor cleanup.

2013-11-26  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@downspout.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/index.css: Tweak fonts in index view.

	* .gitignore: Things to ignore on downspout.

2013-08-13  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/keybindings.js: Use "event.which" rather
	than "event.keyCode" to figure out which key was pressed, since
	keycodes are inconsistent across browsers and hard to work with.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh, htdocs/skins/fancy/feeds.jsh:
	Listen for "keypress" rather than "keydown".

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/feeds.jsh: Don't explicitly specify "o: json"
	when requesting JSON data: it's implied.

	* MANIFEST: Add checkbox images.

	* lib/parse-feed.inc: Apparently can't use call-by-reference for
	built-in functions anymore in PHP 5.3.

	* lib/net.inc: Take care of curl_multi being really picky in how
	it's used.

	* lib/database.inc: Abort better if we can't get a database
	connection.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: Don't explicitly specify "o: json"
	when requesting JSON data. enter_item() now handles unmarking the
	previous current item, making exit_item() obsolete.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/Makefile: SVGs are pictures too!

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/xhr.js: get_json_data() now automatically
	sets "o=json" because hey, what other kind of output are we going
	to request?

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/guess-mobile.js: iPad-specific viewport.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/CacheManager.js: Don't specify "o: json"
	when requesting JSON data: it's implied.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/ipad.css: Just use the default font size on
	iPad.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/android.css: Moving toward having custom
	checkbox images, rather than the browser-default ones, to make
	them more clickable on small screens.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/Checkbox.svg,
	htdocs/skins/fancy/Checkbox-red.svg (added) Images for checkboxes,
	for later.

	* htdocs/newsbite.manifest.php: Added (commented out) checkbox
	images, for later.

2013-08-06  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.css: Added style for future floating
	navbar. Integrated changes from downspout: trying to make
	checkboxes more clickable on small screens.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.php: Added future floating navbar;
	window orientation.

2013-05-27  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* lib/net.inc: Handle gzip-compressed RSS feeds (Jalopnik and
	other Gawker feeds).

2013-04-24  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/CacheManager.js (minor) Removed some
	unwanted trace statements.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: Instead of unmarking current item
	when mouse exits it, unmark it only when it enters a new item.
	This gives us sloppy focus-follows-mouse.

2013-04-22  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/feeds.jsh, htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: Add
	"." binding to refresh, to match Twitter.

2013-04-20  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.jsh: Experimental: try to detect when
	we're on/off-line

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.css: Fancier CSS for currently-selected
	item.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/xhr.js: More verbosity on error.

2013-03-16  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* lib/database.inc (bug fix) Fix SQL query to correctly find most
	recent unread articles.

	* lib/database.inc, lib/parse-feed.inc: Remove unused functions.

	* htdocs/feeds.php: "to do" comment.

	* lib/database.inc: Optimize the SQL query in
	db_get_some_feed_items() (or, alternately, make it less retarded):
	Only sort the last_update times from the feed we're interested in,
	and only keep the last 25 elements from that list.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.php: Don't make app run in standalone
	mode on iOS.

	* htdocs/newsbite.manifest.php: Add iOS icon and splash images.

2013-03-08  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.php: Add icon and splash images.

	* MANIFEST: Added icon and splash images.

	* htdocs/newsbite.manifest.php: Add explicit "fetch from net" line
	to manifest.

	* htdocs/login.php: Work even if no "from" specified.

	* htdocs/newsbite.manifest.php: Added some missing entries (mobile
	device CSS).

	* MANIFEST: Add manifest file.

	* htdocs/Makefile: More cleaning. Slight rearrangement.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/view.php, htdocs/skins/fancy/feeds.php: Use
	manifest, for offline reading.

	* htdocs/newsbite.manifest.php: Generate manifest, for web
	applications.

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/Makefile: Need to specify CPP, to override
	built-in one.

	* htdocs/Makefile: Generate manifest when installing.

2013-01-05  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* Makefile.common, htdocs/skins/fancy/Makefile: Moved CPP and
	MAKEDEPEND commands to Makefile.common

2013-01-02  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* htdocs/skins/fancy/js/CacheManager.js: Make log message
	Safari-friendly again.

2013-03-04  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@moist.ooblick.com>

	* Makefile, Makefile.common: Move a few commands from Makefile to
	Makefile.common
