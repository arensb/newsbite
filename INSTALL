REQUIRED SOFTWARE:

Make sure you have the following sofware packages installed:

- Web server (tested with Apache 2.2)
- PHP 5.x
- PHP modules:
	- Curl
	- XML Reader
- MySQL 5.x
- Smarty template engine (included with this distribution)


INSTALLATION:

- Create the database

	You'll need administrative rights to create the database.

	> create database newsbite character set 'utf8';

	In the shell, create the database tables:

	# mysql -u<DBA> -p newsbite < schema.sql

	where "<DBA>" is the name of a user with administrative
	privileges on the database (i.e., a user who can alter the
	"newsbite" database).

	With the "-p" flag, MySQL will prompt you for the password for
	"<DBA>".

- Create a database user for the PHP scripts to access the database:

	Pick a username and password for the PHP scripts to access the
	database. Remember these, because you'll need them further
	down.

	In the example below, the database name is "newsbite", the
	user is "newsbiteuser", and the password is
	"newsbitepassword". Make substitutions as appropriate.

	In MySQL, run:

	> grant delete, insert, select, update
	  on newsbite.*
	  to `newsbiteuser`@`localhost`
	  identified by "newsbitepassword";

- Unpack the Newsbite distribution

	If you're reading this, you've probably unpacked the source tarball.
	If not, do so now.

- Unpack the Smarty distribution

	If you already have Smarty installed, you can use that. If
	not, there's a copy of it in the "Smarty" subdirectory of the
	Newsbite distribution.

- Quick directory overview

	The main directories in the distribution include:

	- htdocs: PHP scripts that will be accessed by the user's
	  browser. These need to be in the web server's DocumentRoot.

	- htdocs/smarty: this contains directories used by Smarty.
	  Some of these need to be writable by the user that will be
	  running the Newsbite PHP scripts (usually the user running
	  httpd).
	  "htdocs/smarty" does not need to be in the DocumentRoot, and
	  it's probably a good idea to install it someplace else.

	- lib: PHP files used by the scripts in "htdocs", but not
	  accessed directly by the browser. These do not need to be in
	  the DocumentRoot.

	- Smarty: Newsbite uses the Smarty template engine, and needs
	  to be able to find it. Smarty does not need to be installed
	  in the DocumentRoot.

- Install "htdocs"

	Copy the "htdocs" directory from the distribution to where you
	want it in the DocumentRoot.

- Install "htdocs/smarty"

	The directory "htdocs/smarty" does not really need to be in
	the DocumentRoot. You can move it elsewhere if you like.

	"htdocs/smarty/templates_c" needs to be writable by the user
	that will be running the Newsbite PHP scripts (usually the
	user that Apache runs as, e.g. "httpd").

	In the shell, as root, run:

	# chown httpd /path/to/smarty/templates_c
	# chmod 755 /path/to/smarty/templates_c

- Install "lib"

	Copy the "lib" directory to where you want it. This does not
	need to be in the DocumentRoot.

	If you're not concerned with security, you can install it
	underneath the "htdocs" directory.

- Install Smarty

	If you already have Smarty installed, find the directory that
	contains the file "Smarty.class.php". You'll need it later.

	If you don't already have Smarty installed, then unpack the
	copy that came with Newsbite (if you haven't already done so).

	Find the directory that contains the file "Smarty.class.php",
	and copy it somewhere. This does not need to be in the
	DocumentRoot. If you're not concerned with security, you can
	put it underneath "htdocs".

	Remember where you put it. You'll need it later.

- Edit the config file

	"lib/config.inc" in the distribution contains configuration
	options for Newsbite. Edit it (wherever you installed it).
	Read the comments to see what each option does.

- Make sure the PHP files can find the "lib" files.

	The distribution contains a "htdocs/.htaccess" file that tells
	PHP to look for auxiliary files in "./lib". Change "./lib" to
	the full pathname to wherever you put the "lib" directory.
	That is, if "config.inc" is in /foo/bar/config.inc, then the
	.htaccess file should contain

	php_value include_path ".:/foo/bar"

	If you're not running Apache, you'll have to do this some
	other way.
