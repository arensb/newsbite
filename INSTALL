- Install the required software and modules:
	- PHP 5.x (might work with earlier versions)
	- PHP Curl module
	- PHP XML Reader module
	- MySQL (tested with 5.0)
	- Smarty (bundled with this package)
	- Web server (tested with Apache 2.2)
- Create the database:
	In MySQL, as the DBA:
	> create database newsbite character set 'utf8';
	> grant delete, insert, select, update
	  on newsbite.*
	  to `newsbite`@`localhost`
	  identified by "password";
	(Obviously, substitute values as appropriate.)

	In shell, create the database tables:
	% mysql -uDBA newsbite < schema.sql
	(Replace "DBA" with whatever your DBA account is.)

- Unpack the newsbite tarball
- Unpack the Smarty tarball.

- Copy the "htdocs" directory to someplace under DocumentRoot.

- Copy the "lib" directory to someplace. Preferably outside of
  DocumentRoot. But if you're lazy, it can be "htdocs/lib".

- Install Smarty somewhere, preferably outside of DocumentRoot.
  - Can move "htdocs/smarty/" someplace else. In that case, edit
  SMARTY_DIR in "lib/config.inc".

- Edit "config.inc":
	- Fill in database access parameters.
	- Set $SMARTY_DIR to the directory containing "Smarty.class.php".

- Edit htdocs/.htaccess, and change "./lib" to wherever you put the
  "lib" directory.

- Make sure "htdocs/smarty/cache" and "htdocs/smarty/templates_c" are
  writable by the user that Apache runs as.
