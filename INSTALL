- Install the required software and modules:
	- PHP 5.x (might work with earlier versions)
	- PHP Curl
	- PHP SimpleXML
	- MySQL (tested with 5.0)
	- Smarty (bundled with this package)
	- Web server (tested with Apache 2.2)
- Create the database:
	In MySQL, as the DBA:
	> create database newsbite character set 'utf8';
	> grant delete, insert, select, update
	  on newsbite.*
	  to `newsbite`@`localhost`
	  identified by "password";
	(Obviously, substitute values as appropriate.)

	In shell, create the database tables:
	% mysql -uDBA newsbite < schema.sql
	(Replace "DBA" with whatever your DBA account is.)

- Edit "config.php":
	- Fill in database access parameters.
	- Set $SMARTY_DIR to the directory containing "Smarty.class.php".
