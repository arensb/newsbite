REQUIRED SOFTWARE:

Make sure you have the following sofware packages installed:

- Web server (tested with Apache 2.2)
- PHP 5.x
- PHP modules:
	- Curl
	- MySQLi (not MySQL)
	- XML Parser
- MySQL 5.x
- (optional) HTMLPurifier, from http://www.htmlpurifier.org/


INSTALLATION:

- Unpack the Newsbite distribution

	If you're reading this, you've probably unpacked the source tarball.
	If not, do so now.

- Create the database

	In MySQL, as a user with administrative rights:

	> create database newsbite character set 'utf8';
	> use newsbite;
	> source /path/to/schema.sql

	where "/path/to/schema.sql" is the path to the "schema.sql" file in
	the Newsbite distribution.

- Create a database user for the PHP scripts to access the database:

	Pick a username and password for the PHP scripts to access the
	database. Remember these, because you'll need them further
	down.

	In the example below, the database name is "newsbite", the
	user is "newsbiteuser", and the password is
	"newsbitepassword". Make substitutions as appropriate.

	In MySQL, as a user with administrative rights:

	> grant delete, insert, select, update
	  on newsbite.*
	  to `newsbiteuser`@`localhost`
	  identified by "newsbitepassword";

- Quick directory overview

	The main directories in the distribution include:

	- htdocs: PHP scripts that will be accessed by the user's
	  browser. These need to be in the web server's DocumentRoot.

	- lib: PHP files used by the scripts in "htdocs", but not
	  accessed directly by the browser. These do not need to be in
	  the DocumentRoot.

	- plugins: PHP scripts used by the ones in "htdocs" and "lib",
	  but not accessed directly by the browser. These do not need
	  to be in the DocumentRoot.

- Install "htdocs"

	Copy the "htdocs" directory from the distribution to where you
	want it in the DocumentRoot.

- Add authentication in .htaccess

	* To use digest authentication:

	- Make sure mod_auth_digest is enabled in the Apache config:

	LoadModule auth_digest_module /path/to/mod_auth_digest.so

	- add to .htpasswd (in the same directory as the .php files):

	AuthType Digest
	AuthName "Newsbite on MySite"
	AuthDigestDomain /newsbite/
	AuthDigestProvider
	AuthUserFile /path/to/.digest_pw
	Require valid-user

	- Create .digest_pw

	> htdigst -c /path/to/.digest_pw "Newsbite on MySite" myusername
	Adding password for myusername in realm Newsbite on MySite.
	New password: 
	Re-type new password: 

- Install "lib"

	Copy the "lib" directory to where you want it. This does not
	need to be in the DocumentRoot.

	If you're not concerned with security, you can install it
	underneath the "htdocs" directory.

- Install "plugins"

	Copy the "plugins" directory to where you want it. By default,
	this can go underneath "htdocs".

- Install HTMLPurifier

	HTMLPurifier tidies up poorly-written HTML in feeds that can
	mess up the layout of the page. One side effect is that it
	also removes non-standard or non-whitelisted HTML elements,
	which can make the feed look different from what the author
	intended.

	If you want to use it, install it somewhere:
	- Unpack the HTMLPurifier distribution
	- Put the "library" directory somewhere

	and set HTMLPURIFIER_LIB in the config file.

- Edit the config file

	"lib/config.inc" in the distribution contains configuration
	options for Newsbite. Edit it (wherever you installed it).
	Read the comments to see what each option does.

	In particular, you'll need to set a server-side secret
	password. This is never used by humans, so it's best to use a
	randomly-generated string.

- Make sure the PHP files can find the "lib" files.

	The distribution contains a "htdocs/.htaccess" file that tells
	PHP to look for auxiliary files in "./lib". Change "./lib" to
	the full pathname to wherever you put the "lib" directory.
	That is, if "config.inc" is in /foo/bar/config.inc, then the
	.htaccess file should contain

	<IfModule mod_php5.c>
		php_value include_path "/path/to/lib"
	</IfModule>

	where "/path/to/lib" is the directory where you put the lib/*
	files.

	If you're not running Apache, you'll have to do this some
	other way.

- Point your browser at wherever you put the htdocs/* files.

	You should be prompted for a password. Once you do, you'll see
	a page with a toolbar and not much else.

- Change to a prettier skin

	You'll need to have cookies turned on for this to work.

	"fancy" is the best supported skin.

- Add some feeds.

	Click on "Add a feed". Or, if you have an OPML file from
	another newsreader, you can import that with "Import OPML
	file".

- (Optional) Add a cron job to update feeds

	Or you can just do it manually.

	0 7,9,11,14,17,20 * * * CRON=true /usr/local/bin/php-cgi -d include_path=/path/to/lib /path/to/htdocs/update.php -- id=all >/dev/null

The "CRON=true" environment variable allows the script to bypass
authentication.

And you're finally done.
